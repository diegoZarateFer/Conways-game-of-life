# Conway's game of life
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's not really a game in the traditional sense, but rather a mathematical model that simulates the behavior of cells in a grid based on a set of simple rules. Despite its simplicity, it can produce complex and interesting patterns.
